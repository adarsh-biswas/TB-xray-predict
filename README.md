# TB-xray-predict
Deep learning-based system to detect Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Trained the model on a labeled medical imaging dataset to accurately classify TB-positive cases. Employed OpenCV for image processing and visualization to support medical analysis and early diagnosis.
